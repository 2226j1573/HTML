   <P>Ice coffee</P>
   <p>Cold Coffee is a popular chilled beverage made with coffee, sugar and milk/water. It is made in so many different ways across the world with varying ingredients like whipping cream, ice cream, coffee syrup etc. Since this recipe uses milk, I have used a blender to create a thick and frothy cold coffee.</p>
